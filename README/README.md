## Gameplay

In **TheFarmerWasReplaced**, I have to take on the role of an AI entity, helping to manage a farm's daily tasks. The farm is now fully automated, but it still requires your problem-solving skills to handle unexpected scenarios like weather changes, crop infestations, and equipment malfunctions. 

As the farm's AI, I have to:
1. **Harvest Crops** - Use optimized algorithms to harvest fields efficiently.
2. **Manage Resources** - Track and distribute resources like water and fertilizer.
3. **Handle Emergencies** - Respond quickly to scenarios that could harm the farm's output, such as pest invasions.
4. **Complete Missions** - Achieve specific goals within time or resource limits to unlock new levels and upgrades.
